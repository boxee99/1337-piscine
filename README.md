### Sharing My Piscine Journey at 1337 Coding School (42 Network)

Over the course of a month, I immersed myself in a rigorous and rewarding experience at 1337 Coding School, part of the 42 Network. The focus was on mastering the fundamentals of C language through intense discipline and self-learning.

Every task was a mini project, like C00, designed to challenge us while promoting 100% peer learning. No traditional instructorsâ€”just fellow coders helping each other out. It was all about collaboration, problem-solving, and improving through feedback.

Fridays were dedicated to practical challenges. For four hours, we had to solve problems without any external resources or internet access, testing our knowledge and adaptability.

The month concluded with the final exam: eight hours of applying everything we had learned. It was the ultimate test of skill, persistence, and growth over the entire month of Piscine.

If you're a 42 pisciner, it's highly recommended that you go through the process of writing your own code and testing it yourself rather than copying and pasting code that you only partially understand.
