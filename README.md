# 1337 Piscine 
sharing my piscine experience at 1337 coding school powered by 42network , 1 month of discipline and dive into C language , solve mini projects with 100% peer learning , its working on mini projects like C00.

every friday you need to practice what you learn , 4 hours to solve mini problems with no internet .

finaly is a final exam , 8 hour to practice what you learn in full month .

If you're a 42 pisciner, it's highly recommended that you go through the process of writing your own code and testing it yourself rather than copying and pasting code that you only partially understand.
